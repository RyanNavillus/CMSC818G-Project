Attack-Resistant Federated Learning with Residual-based Reweighting,"Federated learning has a variety of applications in multiple domains by utilizing private training data stored on different devices. However, the aggregation process in federated learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks so that the global model may behave abnormally under attacks. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel aggregation algorithm with residual-based reweighting to defend federated learning. Our aggregation algorithm combines repeated median regression with the reweighting scheme in iteratively reweighted least squares. Our experiments show that our aggregation algorithm outperforms other alternative algorithms in the presence of label-flipping and backdoor attacks. We also provide theoretical analysis for our aggregation algorithm."
Certifiably-Robust Federated Adversarial Learning via Randomized Smoothing,"Federated learning is an emerging data-private distributed learning framework, which, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although several heuristic defenses are proposed to enhance the robustness of federated learning, they do not provide certifiable robustness guarantees. In this paper, we incorporate randomized smoothing techniques into federated adversarial training to enable data-private distributed learning with certifiable robustness to test-time adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that such an advanced federated adversarial learning framework can deliver models as robust as those trained by the centralized training. Further, this enables provably-robust classifiers to ℓ2-bounded adversarial perturbations in a distributed setup. We also show that one-point gradient estimation based training approach is 2−3× faster than popular stochastic estimator based approach without any noticeable certified robustness differences."
Data Poisoning Attacks Against Federated Learning Systems,"Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm for distributed training of large-scale deep neural networks in which participants’ data remains on their own devices with only model updates being shared with a central server. However, the distributed nature of FL gives rise to new threats caused by potentially malicious participants. In this paper, we study targeted data poisoning attacks against FL systems in which a malicious subset of the participants aim to poison the global model by sending model updates derived from mislabeled data. We first demonstrate that such data poisoning attacks can cause substantial drops in classification accuracy and recall, even with a small percentage of malicious participants. We additionally show that the attacks can be targeted, i.e., they have a large negative impact only on classes that are under attack. We also study attack longevity in early/late round training, the impact of malicious participant availability, and the relationships between the two. Finally, we propose a defense strategy that can help identify malicious participants in FL to circumvent poisoning attacks, and demonstrate its effectiveness."
